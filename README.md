- 🌱 larger Projekts 
                🌱 In one of my latest Projekts, I am working on my own PHP framework, just for fun and to get in Touch with verios                     Concepts.
                        I even managed to make my Framework an installable composer module, wich I'm very proud of. 
                        Even though, my Framework is far from being production ready, I am even sure it has some serios savety flaws, 
                        it still gave me a pretty good idea about some important concepts used in the wild.
