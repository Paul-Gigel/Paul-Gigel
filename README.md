- 🌱 I’m currently learning PHP and C/C++

        I even managed to make my Framework an installable composer module, wich I'm very proud of. 
        Even though, my Framework is far from being production ready, I am even sure it has some serios savety flaws, 
        it still gave me a pretty good idea about some important concepts used in the wild.
