- 🌱 my actual projects 
        🌱 In one of my latest Projekts, I am working on my own PHP framework, just for fun and to get in Touch with verios                     Concepts.
                I even managed to make my Framework an installable composer module, wich I'm very proud of. 
                Even though, my Framework is far from being production ready, I am even sure it has some serios savety flaws, 
                it still gave me a pretty good idea about some important concepts used in the wild.
        🌱 As a small side-project I'm currently writing a programm to structure data in the form of a linked-list, 
                with out using any pre-chewed solution.
